\section{Experimental setup}
The current experiment is still being discussed, however the infrastructure allows us to test two different phishing detection models and then utilize metrics such as the average rate of phishing detected and the average phishing probability returned by the model. The current model-service endpoints does not yet support predictions with known feature-label pairs so it is not yet possible to determine metrics such as accuracy. An example hypothesis that can currently be tested could be: \textit{A model trained on fewer epochs is more likely to predict "legitimate" and therefore has a lower average phishing rate.}
