\section{Introduction}

This is a minimal version of ACM's consolidated article template that can be used for reports in classes.
Styles are original, but some information, like the conference, keywords, or other overhead that is only relevant for publishing, has been removed through redefinition of commands in the beginning of the document.

This document can be used like any other latex document.
Please note that you \emph{MUST NOT} change the formatting (e.g., font sizes, line heights, margins, ...).
However, the \emph{structure} of the document (e.g., abstract, introduction, ...) usually needs editing to reflect the assignment instructions.
